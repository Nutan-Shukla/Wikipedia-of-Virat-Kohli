                 2nd March 2008 - The day when a team of young Indians made the whole nation proud by winning 
                 the U-19 Cricket World Cup beating South Africa in the finals. A team which under the captaincy
                 of a fearless young boy named Virat Kohli showed no signs of anxiety and ruthlessly stood 
                 toe-to-toe against very opposition. A new star was born that day, a future Indian captain was found.

            
                                             

                 Arrogant, egoistic, over aggressive, over the top and tons of other adjectives have been used to 
                 describe Virat Kohli and though his actions do seem to justify them at times but there's a lot more 
                 to Virat Kohli than just his antics. One could easily spot his celebrations, his reactions, his 
                 abuses on the field and label them over-the-top but it's a sport. It's passion that is been displayed
                  out there. As a sports fan I'd love to watch an excited Virat Kohli jumping around, pumping his
                 fists, swearing at times. It pumps him up, it pumps the fans up, an adrenaline rush is always a fun
                  element in sports. And well, quite frankly, a humble, a respectful and a well behaved Virat Kohli
                   will NOT be the same Virat Kohli that millions of us love.


              He is the modern day cricketer. Well gelled hair, flaunting tattoos, oozing confidence,
                always well dressed. And then you put him on the cricket field with a bat in hand and he gets the job done.
